# so we want to put those into one single state and construct a 
# matrix with only 2 states, A and B, as follows:

# old state -> new state
# 0 -> A
# 1 -> A
# 2 -> B

# the membership matrix chi defines this map
# each row gives us a binary encoding for a given
# state 0, 1, 2 to a state A, B

# state  goes to A, B

# this could be a 'fuzzy' state assignment as well.


# the resulting 'coarse' transition matrix is this.
# compare the probabilities to the above one.
